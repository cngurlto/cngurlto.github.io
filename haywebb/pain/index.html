<p1 style="font-family:'verdana'">HERE ARE THE TOP 15 SENSOR TYPES BEING USED BY IOT APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES :</p>


<p style="font-size:30px">
<p2 style="color:violet">Temperature sensors : A device, used to measure amount of heat energy that allows to detect a physical change in temperature</p2>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p3 style="color:powderblue">Proximity sensor : A device that detects the presence or absence of a nearby object.</p3>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p4 style="color:black">Water quality sensor : These sensors play an important role as they monitor the quality of water for different purposes.</p4>

<p style="font-size:30px">

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p6 style="color:grey"><Chemical sensor : Their goal is to indicate changes in liquid or to find out air chemical changes.</p6>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p7>Gas sensor : Gas sensors are similar to the chemical ones, but are specifically used to monitor changes of the air quality and detect the presence of various gases.</p7>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p8 style="color:yellow">
<p8>Smoke Sensor : A smoke sensor is a device that senses smoke (airborne particulates & gases), and itâ€™s level.</p8>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p9>Level sensors : A sensor which is used to determine the level or amount of fluids, liquids or other substances that flow in an open or closed system is called Level sensor.</p9>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p10>Image sensors : Image sensors are instruments which are used to convert optical images into electronic signals for displaying or storing files electronically.</p10>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p11 style="color:red">Motion detection sensors
A motion detector is an electronic device which is used to detect the physical movement</p11>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p12 style="color:lightgreen">Accelerometer sensors
Accelerometer is a transducer that is used to measure the physical or measurable acceleration.</p12>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p13>Gyroscope sensors : A sensor or device which is used to measure the angular rate </p13>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p14 style="color:pink">Humidity sensors : Humidity is defined as the amount of water vapour in an atmosphere of air</p14>

<p style="font-size:30px">
<p15 style="color:limegreen">Optical sensors
A sensor which measures the physical quantity of light rays and convert it into electrical signal.</p15>
