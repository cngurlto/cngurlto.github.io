<h1> July2020 Flipgrid Project. </h1>
<p>This was a cool project, I added my website into it so that made it more fun for me. This is not a great website but then again I did create it by hand so it will never be the best
I would appreciate it if you could check out a little bit more of my website. I know it is really bad but I worked hard on it. I would redirect you back to the Flipgrid project but I 
do not know the link. Please email me the project link so I can put it on the website. I apologize for the Mic, I had a different one but my laptop switched on me before I started 
I didn't want to redo it as I had done it using the Whiteboard on Flipgrid and Slides and It might get lost or something like that. So I decided to keep this one. Well hope you enjoy!
